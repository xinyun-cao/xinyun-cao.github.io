							<h2>My research interest lies in Human Computer Interaction, Accessibility, and Mixed Reality.</h2>
						</header>
						<p>I am currently a Ph.D. candidate working with <a href="https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~profdj/">Prof. Dhruv Jain</a> in <a href="https://accessibility.eecs.umich.edu/">
							the Soundability Lab</a> at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. My work focus on accessibility in Mixed Reality. Specifically, I am interested in developing multi-modal, AI-driven tools and systems to make mixed reality and immersive 3D environments more accessible. My work has been published at top HCI and Accessibility Conferences like ASSETS, CHI, UIST, and DIS. Prior to joining UMich, I graduated from UC Berkeley in May 2022 and worked with <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bjoern/?_ga=2.43492518.2062107655.1695965555-369761381.1695965555">Prof. Bjoern Hartmann</a> and <a href="https://jamesdsmith.net/">James Smith</a>. I have also worked in the Gaming Industry and the Pharma Tech Industry as a Software Engineer.</p>
