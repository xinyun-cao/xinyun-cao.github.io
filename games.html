								<p>I have had the amazing opportunity to work on several games, professionally and as personal projects. 
									I love paying attention to interaction details during game development, which is why I enjoy games in the first place!</p>

								<h2>Adventure Chef Merge Explorer</h2>
								<p>When working for Pocket Gems, I worked as a Software Engineer on both Frontend and Backend on the game Adventure Chef, Merge Explorer. It is a casual mobile game with merging, food truck cooking, and adventure elements.</p>
								<p>Unfortunately, this game was discontinued by the company, but here's <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/adventure-chef-merge-explorer-inspired-by-long-drives-and-manga/">an interview of the team lead with Pocket Gamer</a>!</p>

								<h2>Lost Remembrance</h2>
								<p>For the 2021 Global Game Jam, I worked as the Designer and Developer with several others on the game Lost Remembrance. We explored the effect of layering music and using that as hints in an escape-room-style game. </p>
